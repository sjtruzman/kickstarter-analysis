# Kickstarting with Excel - Challenge

## Overview

This analysis focus on the outcome based on the relation between the launch date and the goals on Louis's fundraising campaigns. 

### Purpose
Compare how the fundraising campaigns performed based on launch date and goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

When we analyze the outcome based on the launch date we can appreciate a positive trend in a few effective months we're the successful outcome is increassing constantly and then it starts decreasing. These months were we have a positive result or an increment on the successful outcome would be from March to May and then on June we see a decrease all the way until December. Launch dates don't affect the canceled campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

When we analyze the outcomes based on the goals we can appreciate a trend that is decreasing on the successful campaigns while the goal increases. There is only a spike on 2 big goal amounts but after them it will continue to decrease. So when we increase the goal the successful outcome rate is decreasing and the failed are incrementing. For the canceled campaigns the goal was not a factor to decide the outcome.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

For this analysis we had to ensure we collected the correct data based on Louis's requirements. Also formulating the correct formulas in excel to get exactly the results we needed. 

## Results


- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

To Finish this analysis we can conclude that the outcomes based on launch dates are a important factor for the outcome to be successful because there is a positive trend between March to May.
Also the month of May was the most effective month because it had the biggest amount of successful outcome. So to conclude this analysis based on the Launch date Louis should launch more campaigns between March and May and use May carefully because it can give her the best result of the year.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

For the second analysis we conclude that the while the goal increases the successful outcome decreases aver the time and the failed outcome increment. for the cancelled the goal did not affect at all. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Limitations on the dataset would be that we don't have enough data of the bigger goal amounts to really have a final conclusion over these types of campaigns and on the launch dates we have many differences on the exact amount of campaigns launched each month. We would have needed a more equal count of each one to get a more accurate conclusion.
